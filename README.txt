This project is a java implementation of the game 2048 with a couple twists to it.
It has a Christmas theme with festive decorations on the tiles, cool music, and a fun background.
The code is divided into numerous classes where each class control a different part of the game.
There are three different gamemodes that are implemented.
Traditional is the standard 2048 game.
Time Trial is when you try to get the highest score you can in a minute.
Move limit is you have a certain amount of moves to get the highest score.
There are also three options for grid size with square sizes 4,5,6
There is background music and sounds for when you move the tiles.
The user can also adjust the theme and volume in the settings.
They can also start a new game or view the leaderboard at any time. 
If you lose the traditional mode or are stuck, you get the chance to play a game of minesweeper.
This will grant you a second chance if you win.
Once you have lost or completed the game, you can input your name into the leaderboard.
To run the code you run the GUI2048
